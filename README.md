# Piplator

This is a forex pip calculator for MT4/MT5 as the volume sizes 
which are the lot sizes in other accounts. It is only currently 
compatible with currencies that are paired against it like EU/
USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD and so forth.

It is written in Typescript and React.js for type safety as we are dealing with numbers so we need to be type-safe without comprimising performance as this calculator aims to quickly calculate for scalping. As most forex pip calculators have ads or need to press a button for it to load the results, this calculator will instantly display the results once entry price, stop loss price, target profit price and volume lot size has been added. 

Here is the website link for quick reference and calculation:
